This inspired a booklet I wrote called **\"What can I do?'</strong> to help patients change their lifestyle to maximize their chance of a good outcome. The website will be an expanded resource to help you on your cancer journey. </p>\n<p>Through the blog I will bring you the science and practical advice you need to make changes. On the resources page you will find links to books, articles and websites that can help you. If there is a cost attached I try to find the cheapest price for you. I make no money from the resources.</p>\n<p>You can follow us on Aacebook and Instagrgam. If you like listening to the articles you can find them on apple podcast and Spotify. If you would like notifications of when a new article is written, you can submit your name and email on the front page.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About What The Cancer","full_image":"/img/about-two.jpg","leftBackground":"/img/39748560_10157016425674369_11675533586726912_n-2-.jpg","leftTitle":"Our Resources","leftLink":"/resources","rightTitle":"Meet Lisa","rightDescription":"Medical Oncologist","rightUrl":"/lisa"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d60af8c4-0fb6-5f65-b889-c45d1f78a26e"}}
